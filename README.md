## Overview

OSUTOOL is a utility designed for players of the popular rhythm game osu!. This tool allows users to change the background image of all beatmaps in their osu! directory to a single image of their choice. It simplifies the process of customizing the look of all beatmaps, providing a more personalized gaming experience.

## Features
- Change all beatmap backgrounds to a specific image with just a few clicks.
- Easy to use interface built with CustomTkinter for a modern look.
- Automatically saves and loads the last used paths to streamline the user experience.

## Requirements
To run OSUTOOL, you need the following:
- Python 3.6 or newer
- Install `customtkinter` using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter


**Alternatively**, 
you can simply use the executable file provided in the Releases section at your convenience.

## Usage
Enter the path to your osu! Songs directory in the "Osu Song path" field.
Enter the path to the image you want to set as the background for all beatmaps in the "Image of the background path" field.
Click the "Replace" button to apply the changes.

## How It Works
OSUTOOL modifies the background image for each beatmap found in the specified osu! Songs directory. It replaces the existing background file with the selected new image file, ensuring that all beatmaps will display the new background during gameplay.
